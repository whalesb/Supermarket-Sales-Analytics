  - **Female customers contribute significantly more to gross income compared to male customers.**  
    - Categories like **Food and Beverages** and **Fashion Accessories** are especially popular among female shoppers.  
    - This highlights the importance of tailoring marketing strategies and offers toward female customers to maximize profitability.  

## Prediction
